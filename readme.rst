Blackboard provides `documentation on how to upload grades to an existing column`_,
but does not provide any examples. This repository has three:

- `<01.tsv>`_
- `<02.tsv>`_
- `<03.tsv>`_

It also has a `Makefile`_ that properly concatenates them
into a single file called ``upload.xls``.

To get the correct column names,
use *Work Offline* : *Download* : *Full Grade Center*.
The column name will be something like this::

    Quiz 3 [Total Pts: 10] |664617
